1. Run XGB with hard coded hyperparameters and only trained on train set
2. Run LGBM classifier on ALL data: Best so far
3. Experiments with ALL data kept: Seems good

For the best model:
1. Outlier removal on the 97th percentile
2. Unskew right skewed data
4. BaseEncoding of geoIDs with a base of 3
5. Additional Auto-Encoding after the BaseEncoding to reduce dimensionality of GeoID features to 5

Feature splitting: no Improvement
Clustering of height: No Improvement

lgbm seems to perform better!
Check max_depth of lgbm to 4: No improvement

Use AutoEncoder for dim-reduction on baseN encoded columns!
