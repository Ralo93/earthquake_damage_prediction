1. Run XGB with hard coded hyperparameters and only trained on train set
2. Run LGBM classifier on ALL data: Best so far
3. Experiments with ALL data kept: Seems good

For the best model:
1. Outlier removal
2. Unskew right skewed data
3. Interaction terms of geoIDs
4. BaseEncoding of geoIDs

Feature splitting: no Improvement
Clustering of height: No Improvement

lgbm seems to perform better!
Check max_depth of lgbm to 4: No improvement

Encoding the geoIDs with different bases
